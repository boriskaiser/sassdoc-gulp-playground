# Playground for [SassDoc](http://sassdoc.com) with [Gulp](http://gulpjs.com)

## About SassDoc
SassDoc is to Sass what JSDoc is to JavaScript: a documentation system to build pretty and powerful docs in the blink of an eye. Among other things, SassDoc is:
- usable out of the box;
- highly customisable;
- blazingly fast;
- fully themable;
